- The scripts folder contains multiple scripts.
- "BlueUnit" and "RedUnit" scripts inherit properties from the parent class "Unit" and handle movement and other necessary functions.
- Movement is facilitated using the AiPath script obtained from the A* pathfinder project.
- Additionally, there exists a script called "UnitMovementTest," which I attempted to create from scratch as an alternative to AiPath. However, due to optimization issues and multiple bugs, I opted not to use it.
- The units can now set new targets when the first target is destroyed.
- Added an event panel showing in-game events which can be scrolled through by dragging the cursor on the panel screen.
- The units might get stuck behind other units of same team as local avoidance is not implemented since free version of A* pathfinding project is used.
