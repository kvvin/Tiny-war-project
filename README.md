- The scripts folder contains multiple scripts.
- "BlueUnit" and "RedUnit" scripts inherit properties from the parent class "Unit" and handle movement and other necessary functions.
- Movement is facilitated using the AiPath script obtained from the A* pathfinder project.
- Additionally, there exists a script called "UnitMovementTest," which I attempted to create from scratch as an alternative to AiPath. However, due to optimization issues and multiple bugs, I opted not to use it.
- Despite its functionality, the project suffers from several bugs, such as failing to reset the target of Units that already have a target set when the targets are destroyed, causing them to remain stationary and continue attacking.
